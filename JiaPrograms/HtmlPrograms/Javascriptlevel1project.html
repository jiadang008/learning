        <h1>Welcome to Part 9: Your JavaScript Level One Project!</h1>
        <p>For this project you will be building a genetic website that will seem to ask mundane questions to normal users, but you secretly are looking for a spy! Anyone visiting your website will be asked questions, only the Spy will be able to give specific answers you expect. If all questions are answerd correctly, you will post a secret message in console for the spy to read!</p>
        <p>Here are the four conditions you will check for the spy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Spy has the same letter of her First Name and Last Name</li>
            <li>The Spy is between the Age of 20 and 30</li>
            <li>The Spy is at least 170 centimeters tall </li>
            <li>The Spy has a pet name that ends with the letter "y"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We are going to leave this project a little more open ended, but if you feel like you need more guidence, check the solution walkthrough videos! But believe it or not, we've actually covered everything you need to know to complete this task. I would suggest you use JavaScript to prompt the user information and set these to variables. Then use these variables to check for four conditions to all be true. Its up to you what the secret message is!</p>
        <p>A spy with the following information should see your secret message:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Jose Jhonson</li>
            <li>26 years old</li>
            <li>175 centimeters tall</li>
            <li>Pet name is "Sammy"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Keep in mind you can ask the question prompts inwhatever order you want, you can even seperate asking for the First Name and then another prompt for last name</p>
        <p>Also remember tp switch out the script src to your own .js file! Right now it's connected the Part9.js which contains the solutions</p>
